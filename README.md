# Fake No More 

## Description
Fake No More is a project focused on identifying whether an audio file contains a real human voice or one generated by AI. Developed during the final two weeks of the Le Wagon Bootcamp, this model uses machine learning techniques to address the growing challenge of deepfake audio detection.

Using advanced audio feature extraction and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, the model analyzes the patterns in voice recordings to make accurate predictions.

What is Deep Fake Voice?
Deep fake voice, also known as voice synthesis or AI-generated voice, is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can create convincing audio imitations of a person's voice. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, these systems analyze and replicate the nuances of human speech, including tone, pitch, accent, and speaking style. The resulting synthetic voices can be indistinguishable from real human voices to the untrained ear.

The process involves training models on large datasets of audio recordings of the target voice. Once the model is trained, it can generate new speech in the target voice based on any input text. This technology has advanced rapidly, making it possible to produce highly realistic and convincing audio that can mimic a specific individual.

# Preprocessing
Extracted features from the audio files:
- Mfcc
- Chroma stft
- Spectral contrast
- Zero crossing rate
- Spectral bandwidth
- Spectral rolloff

# Model
## LSTM
LSTM networks are ideal for detecting fake voices because they analyize audio sequentially. 
They capture temporal dependencies, handle long feature sequences, and identify subtle inconsistencies in pitch or tone that differentiate real and AI-generated voices.
